## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 to be written__
    - to be written - blah de blah

      ![to be writen](to be written)

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __to be written__
    - Cto be written
    - confirmation modal dialog is very basic and could be improved
    - booking form could be improved to show a month to view calendar with colour coding for scheduled hikes rather than the drop-down
    - functionality could be added to check for hike capacity and compare that with the booking request to automatically approve/confirm bookings
    - google maps could be included to pin hike meeting points and show routes
    - a weather app/widget could be included to show forcasted weather conditions
    

## Design

-   ### Typography, Imagery and Colour Scheme

-   ### Wireframes

need a note here to say that wireframes have not been done for the django pages that manip data model (look up correct term here)

    <summary>ER Diagrams</summary>

    ![ER Diagrams](to be written)
    </details>

    ******************  the following text needs to be tidied up and improved as a description of the er diagrams

  the diagrams show the logical data model.  The many-to-many relationship between hikes and likes is represented as normalized tables to clarify 
the relationship.  In the models.py file the likes data item is declared as part of the Hike class, with django handling how this relationship is represented in the physical database tables
in the background.

The users table in the diagram is also a logical representation of the data captured during user registration and how it relates to the application
data model.  The users table itself is not declared in the models.py file, but is handled by the auth??? modules?? in django and this logical view does not
reflect all columns and constraints etc. used by the physical data tables in the database.

The data model tables are split into two diagrams so that the relationships between the tables can be easily read.

A booking is a many-to-many relationship between schedule and users but because it also has it's own data - places_reserved, it is declared as
it's own separate class in models.py

Because there could be multiple guided hikes on the same hike trail in a single day, the schedule table needs a composite primary key of the
hike_id and 'starts' column.  This is handled using a constraint in models.py.

### Known bugs

- to be written

## Deployment

to be written blah blah  - don't forget to mention DEBUG

check for errors
check for commented out code
do I need to test settings.py

1. Create application and Postgres DB on Heroku
2. Create Postgres DB and link on app on Heroku
3. Configure environment variables

### How to clone the repository 

- Go to the https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/pf4-guided-hike-booker repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project

### Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
- Log in to Heroku at https://heroku.com - create an account if needed.
- From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.  For a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, otherwise a link to this function is located under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.
- On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select region.  Then click Create app.
- On the Application Configuration page for the new app, click on the Resources tab.
- In the Add-ons search bar enter "Postgres" and select "Heroku Postgres" from the list - click the "Submit Order Form" button on the pop-up dialog.
- Next click on Settings on the Application Configuration page and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button - check the DATABASE_URL has been automatically set up. 
- Add a new Config Var called SECRET_KEY and assign it a value - any random string of letters, digits and symbols.
- The settings.py file should be updated to use the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY environment variable values as follows :

  - DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}

  - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- In Gitpod, in the project terminal window, run the command : python3 manage.py migrate to initialize the data model in postgres database.
- Make sure the project requirements.txt file is up to date with all necessary supporting files by entering the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Commit and push any local changes to GitHub.

### Configure Cloudinary to host images used by the application
- Log in to Cloudinary - create an account if needed.  To create the account provide your name, email and setup a password.  For "primary interest" you can choose "Programmable Media for image and video API".  Click "Create Account" and you will be sent an email to verify your account and bring you to the dashboard.
- From the dashboard, copy the "API Environment variable" value by clicking on the "Copy to clipboard" link.
- Log in to Heroku and go to the Application Configuration page for the application.  Click on Settings and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
- Add a new Config Var called CLOUDINARY_URL and assign it the value copied from the Cloudinary dashboard, but remove the "CLOUDINARY_URL=" at the beginning of the string. 

### Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
- Go to the Application Configuration page for the application on Heroku and click on the Deploy tab.
- Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub. Enter the name of the github repository (the one used for this project is (https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/pf4-guided-hike-booker) and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.
- Scroll down the page and choose to either Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project Automatic Deploy was selected.
- The application can be run from the Application Configuration page by clicking on the Open App button.
- The live link for this project is (https://banffnp.herokuapp.com/)
