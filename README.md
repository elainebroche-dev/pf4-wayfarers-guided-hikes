## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__
    The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement each page supporting easy and intuitive navigation.  It includes a Logo, and a link to the Home page. If the user is not logged in then links are availabe to the Register and Sign in pages.  If a user is logged in then the links availabe in addition to the Home link are for My Bookings and Sign out; and the active username and a user icon are also displayed.
    
    If the user logged in is the admin user then an additional link of Admin is also shown on the navigation bar.  This link takes the user to the Django Admin screens where data in the underlying database can be added, retrieved, modified and deleted.
    
    The navigation bar is responsive on multiple screen sizes - on smaller screens it coverts to a 'burger' menu style.

    ![Navbar Burger](documentation/supp-images/f01-nav-bar-3.png)


-   __F02 Landing page image and text__
    - At the top of the landing page (home page) there is an area that includes a photograph and a text overlay which together clearly identify the purpose of the site as a place to find and book guided hikes in Banff.  

    ![Landing Area](documentation/supp-images/f02-landing.png)

-   __F03 Hike Summaries__
    - Further down on the landing/home page a list of hike summaries are shown.  Each summary gives an image of the hike, a title, details on distance and estimated duration, number of likes and easy to read label on the hike image rating the difficulty of the route - easy/moderate/hard.   At a glance the user can decide quickly if this is a hike that might appeal to them.  To keep the page uncluttered, summaries are limited to a maximum of 6 per page, with pagination available when more than 6 hike routes exist.
    
    ![Hike Summaries](documentation/supp-images/f03-hike-summaries.png)

-   __F04 Hike Detail Page__
    - When a user clicks on a hike summary title on the home page they are brought to the Hike Detail page for the clicked hike.  Here the user is shown a full description of the hike, information on when the hike details were created and last edited, the trailhead location for the hike, the difficulty rating, distance, estimated duration, number of likes, number of comments and they can read all of the comments approved for the hike which are listed in order most recent first.  Only users who are logged in can comment on a hike, 'like' a hike or book a hike if any have been scheduled.  Commenting on a hike is detailed below in F05 Comment on a hike.  Liking a hike is detailed below in F06 Like a hike.  Booking a hike is detailed below in F07 Book a hike.

## Design

-   ### Wireframes

    The wireframe diagrams below describe the Home, Hike Detail, My Bookings, Sign in, Sign out and Register pages.  Wireframes are not provided for theDjango Admin pages used by the application to create data records, publish hike data, approve comments and bookings.

    </details>

-   ### Entity-Relationship diagrams for DBMS
    
      Notes on the ER diagrams :

      - The ER diagrams provided show the logical data model.  The many-to-many relationship between hikes and likes is represented as normalized tables to clarify the relationship.  In the models.py file the likes data item is declared as part of the Hike class, with django handling how this relationship is represented in the physical database tables in the background.

      - The users table in the ER diagrams is also a logical representation of the data captured during user registration and how it relates to the application data model.  The users table itself is not declared in the models.py file, but is handled by the django modules and this logical view does not reflect all columns and constraints etc. used by the physical data tables in the database.

      - The data model tables are split into two diagrams so that the relationships between the tables can be easily read.

      - A booking is a many-to-many relationship between schedule and users but because it also has it's own data - places_reserved, it is declared as it's own separate class in models.py

      - Because there could be multiple guided hikes on the same hike trail in a single day, the schedule table needs a composite primary key of the hike_id and 'starts' column.  This is handled using a constraint in models.py.

## Testing

### Validator Testing 

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    - As this project uses Django templates the html has been validated by manually clicking through the application pages, copying the source of the rendered pages and then validating this version of the html using the W3C Validator (link shown above).  HTML  for the Django admin site pages was not edited so has not been validated here.  The Signup, Login and Logout pages from Django allauth were customized and so have been validated, with results below.

### Automated Testing

  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used to test the application javascript and jquery code.  The functionality tested was code to fade out, slide up and remove any raised alert messages after a 5 second delay.  The code is located in [Script JS](static/js/script.js), the test is located in [Test JS](static/js/tests/script.test.js)

  - Jest test results :     
    ![JS Test Results](documentation/testing/results/jquery-test-results.png)

   - [Django testing tools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/tools/) were used to test the application python code.  
   - DB tests were run in the development environment against a local SQLite3 database. 
   - Tests were written for the following files :

      - [forms.py](hikebooker/forms.py)  test file: [test_forms.py](hikebooker/test_forms.py)
      - [models.py](hikebooker/models.py)  ters file: [test_models.py](hikebooker/test_models.py)
      - [views.py](hikebooker/views.py)  test file: [test_views.py](hikebooker/test_views.py)
      - [admin.py](hikebooker/admin.py)  test file: [test_admin.py](hikebooker/test_admin.py)  (tests were added for the customizations made to the django admin functionality)

## Deployment

to be written blah blah  - don't forget to mention DEBUG

check for errors
check for commented out code
do I need to test settings.py

1. Create application and Postgres DB on Heroku
2. Create Postgres DB and link on app on Heroku
3. Configure environment variables

### How to clone the repository 

- Go to the https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/pf4-guided-hike-booker repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project

### Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
- Log in to Heroku at https://heroku.com - create an account if needed.
- From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.  For a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, otherwise a link to this function is located under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.
- On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select region.  Then click Create app.
- On the Application Configuration page for the new app, click on the Resources tab.
- In the Add-ons search bar enter "Postgres" and select "Heroku Postgres" from the list - click the "Submit Order Form" button on the pop-up dialog.
- Next click on Settings on the Application Configuration page and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button - check the DATABASE_URL has been automatically set up. 
- Add a new Config Var called SECRET_KEY and assign it a value - any random string of letters, digits and symbols.
- The settings.py file should be updated to use the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY environment variable values as follows :

  - DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}

  - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- In Gitpod, in the project terminal window, run the command : python3 manage.py migrate to initialize the data model in postgres database.
- Make sure the project requirements.txt file is up to date with all necessary supporting files by entering the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Commit and push any local changes to GitHub.

### Configure Cloudinary to host images used by the application
- Log in to Cloudinary - create an account if needed.  To create the account provide your name, email and setup a password.  For "primary interest" you can choose "Programmable Media for image and video API".  Click "Create Account" and you will be sent an email to verify your account and bring you to the dashboard.
- From the dashboard, copy the "API Environment variable" value by clicking on the "Copy to clipboard" link.
- Log in to Heroku and go to the Application Configuration page for the application.  Click on Settings and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
- Add a new Config Var called CLOUDINARY_URL and assign it the value copied from the Cloudinary dashboard, but remove the "CLOUDINARY_URL=" at the beginning of the string. 

### Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
